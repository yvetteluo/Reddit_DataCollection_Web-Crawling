Bitcoin as a way to preserve weath across lifetimes,"Join me in a thought experiment. Let us assume that the Afterlife and Reincarnation is real. However, for some unknown reason we keep coming back to this planet to live and start from zero.

And the user can have full access to their funds.Now assume that before somebody dies, they load a certain amount of their wealth onto the blockchain and take the seedphrase with themselves to their grave.Upon their return, all the need is to go to a past life regression therapist (this will become more common in the future, as it's an evolving field of study, people look at past life regression therapy the way they used to look at mental health therapist 50-years ago) and remember the passphrase to unlock their wallets. And they would have full access to their funds.This would be a good way for somebody to ensure their financial stability across lifetimes.Would like to know your thoughts?",19 hours ago,u/Intelligent-Gap-3930,0,22 comments
"Will there ever be viable lending and borrowing, using only Bitcoin as the currency involved? If so, how would that be possible and how could it work, given the implied future deflation of the currency.","One very important (arguably the most important) economic activity, is the allocation of capital from those who have saved it and are not using it, to those who have an idea for it's usage but do not own the capital.  An economy lives by it's ability to efficiently allocate capital, and dies by it's inability to do so.  Bitcoin has extremely heavy implied deflation - all it takes is for a Bitcoiner to die without passing their private key on to their heirs, and that Bitcoin is effectively deflated out of the supply.The late doctor's widow who has large amounts saved up but doesn't spend much, meets a young entrepreneur who wants to open a restaurant.  So she lends him some Bitcoin to start it up(Bitcoin is the currency used by everyone).  He agrees to pay her interest at whatever rate they agree on.  But, because Bitcoin continues to get more and more scarce as time goes on....what is the likely outcome of that loan?  As time goes on, it will invariably become harder and harder for him to pay it back.  That restaurant had better be one whole hell of a success, and/or he'd better repay the loan pretty fast.Do you see the problem here?  The doctor's wife is incentivized by the nature of Bitcoin, to hodl it.  Not to lend it out.  Because she knows that it will be more valuable tomorrow/next year/ten years into the future....so why take the chance?  She'll likely want a high interest rate as compensation for taking the risk, and that makes it even harder for the young fellow to repay it!  But the lending of capital, which is just the allocation of capital in the economy, is vital to the growth of said economy.  In our hypothetical example, the restaurant won't get built because the Bitcoin wouldn't get lent out.My sense tells me that this actually will not be a problem in a Bitcoinized world, but I can't seem to put my finger on the economic reason as to why.  Back to the example - the real capital, and labor, exist to start the restaurant, but won't be allocated to do so.  The grills are there, the building exists, and the workers are ready to go work...but because of the nature of the currency, the decision-makers are incentivized not to proceed....or would they be incentivized to proceed?What's the flaw in this argument against Bitcoin?  Because I've heard it before, and just not sure how to refute it to my friends who want to argue this macro-economic angle.",20 hours ago,u/RonPaulWasR1ght,5,28 comments

A note on banks and swaps.,"After reading this recently posted thread... There some points to be made about the space.The topic is a bit muddled, but let's look at how a large portion of global dollars move around today... and why Bitcoin is almost an antithesis to the way money currently functions.TLDR; we're going to detail how global bank balance sheets enable wholesale global banking (how the money moves around). Largely using a 2017 report from the BIS... and then an opinion as to why Bitcoin would not be desirable (by banks) to replace this function.----going long.Ok, per the post:Big banks move so much money buying and selling bonds, equities, Forex, repo markets etc. that just the SHEER AMOUNT involved in each these transactions automatically triggers slow legacy financial reporting procedures.How much money is moved around daily? Trillions. And how is it accomplished? Repo is one, another major method is currency swaps/synthetic repo. No one really tracks these; and they are only reported in the notes of bank's balance sheets. Example of recording repo/derivatives - JP Morgan Chase financials PDF - pages 167, 186, 189, 192, 199, 289 - Note 29, etc.You'll see wording re: ""off balance sheet"" items, and ""re-pledgable collateral"" (this is the collateral multiplier as viewed via one participant's balance sheet).Some swap transactions aren't recorded because their values are effectively nil... however the notes for a Canadian bank would still have to explain how a bank in Canada can have CAD denominated liabilities offsetting USD assets... and may indicate that a swap has taken place.The BIS aggregated a bunch of bank's balance sheets to try and capture how much swap debt exists... Essentially, how large this global funding market is (shadow banking market). This was not a full activity, and was limited to the banks surveyed.Every day, trillions of dollars are borrowed and lent in various currencies. Many deals take place in the cash market, through loans and securities. But foreign exchange (FX) derivatives, mainly FX swaps, currency swaps and the closely related forwards, also create debt-like obligations. For the US dollar alone, contracts worth tens of trillions of dollars stand open and trillions change hands daily. And yet one cannot find these amounts on balance sheets. This debt is, in effect, missing.Except that it's not missing. These credit created dollars are circulating around the world. They are the cause of M2 skyrocketing from the 1970s through to 2007 despite low Fed reserve levels. These dollars are ""created"" as banks expand their balance sheets... sometimes enabled by selectively transacting off-balance sheet. The same tools can be used to continue to access funding while limiting new commercial loan origination (banks can swap amongst themselves, vs. lending to the broader public to achieve returns).As an example, we can look at Japan. The endless QE regime was supposed to provoke Japanese banks to lend and spur inflation. That inflation never arrived for over 20 years. A Japanese bank could engage in an fx swap, swap Yen for USD and roll that into treasuries. Now the Japanese bank could reap UST yields... avoiding the negative rates they're subject to domestically. All while playing it safe, and not lending to the broader public (ignoring the intention of the Bank of Japan).Anyway.. going off on too much of a tangent. Suffice to say... repo, swaps, other derivatives also function as balance sheet tools. Re-jigging assets and liabilities to allow for further business activity in spite of reserve requirements, or domestic limitations.As a result, we know little about it. How much is owed, by whom and for what purpose: trade hedging, asset-liability management, market-making? What does it imply for measures of international credit like the BIS global liquidity indicators (GLIs)? Answers to these questions can inform assessments of global financing conditions and financial stability. For instance, serious strains seized the FX swap market during the Great Financial Crisis (GFC).There you have it. The BIS (the central bank's central bank) admitting that they can't measure money. Confidence inspiring, ain't it?This is also why 2007/2008 was such a blindside. These markets have been ignored (and largely continue to be).The debt remains obscured from view. Accounting conventions leave it mostly off-balance sheet, as a derivative, even though it is in effect a secured loan with principal to be repaid in full at maturity. Only footnotes to the accounts report it.As stated earlier (and can check the previously linked example bank balance sheet as a reference).Focusing on the dominant dollar segment, we estimate that non-bank borrowers outside the United States have very large off-balance sheet dollar obligations in FX forwards and currency swaps. They are of a size similar to, and probably exceeding, the $10.7 trillion of on-balance sheet debt. On the other side of the ledger, as much as two thirds of the dollar-denominated bonds issued by non-US residents could be hedged through similar off-balance sheet instruments. That fraction seems to have fallen as emerging market borrowers have gained prominence since the GFC.$10T is on balance sheet. The BIS continues to report on this dollar market.. with recent size estimates of over $80T. (It's likely over $100T+ today)Note the key words here ""other side of the ledger"", USD denominated debt not issued in the US, also being pledged as collateral for similar activities... and not included in the $10T estimate in 2017.The implications for financial stability are hard to assess. This requires a more granular analysis of currency and maturity mismatches than the available data allow. Much of the missing dollar debt is likely to be hedging FX exposures, which, in principle, supports financial stability. Even so, rolling short-term hedges of long-term assets can generate or amplify funding and liquidity problems during times of stress.Three closely related instruments allow off-balance sheet foreign currency borrowing and lending: FX swaps, currency swaps and (outright) forwards. In an FX swap, two parties exchange two currencies spot and commit to reverse the exchange at some pre-agreed future date and price. Currency swaps are like FX swaps, except that the two parties agree to exchange both principal and interest payment streams over a longer term. FX swaps mature within a year (providing ‚Äúmoney market‚Äù funding); currency swaps have a longer maturity (‚Äúcapital market‚Äù funding). A forward is a contract to exchange two currencies at a pre-agreed future date and price. After a swap‚Äôs spot leg is done, what is left is the agreed future exchange ‚Äì the forward leg.These transactions are functionally equivalent to borrowing and lending in the cash market. Yet the corresponding debt is not shown on the balance sheet and thus remains obscured.In simpler terms; this activity moves (and creates) dollars on balance sheets... dollars that are used in the real world, but the obligation tied to these dollars is unreported.Why such a difference in accounting treatment? One reason is that forwards and swaps are treated as derivatives, so that only the net value is recorded at fair value, while repurchase transactions are not. Since the value of the forward claim exchanged at inception is the same, the fair value of the contract is zero and it changes only with variations in exchange rates. Yet, unlike with most derivatives, the full notional amount, not just a net amount as in a contract for difference, is exchanged at maturity. That is, the notional amounts are not purely used as reference for the income streams to be exchanged, such as in interest rate derivatives. Another reason is the definition of control, which for cash requires control over the cash itself (eg a demand deposit) but for a security just the right to the corresponding cash flows. This determines what is recognised and not recognised on the balance sheet.This is important to note. The ""money"" here isn't cash, isn't a demand deposit. It's just ledger entries... which comprise all money (physical cash/deposits are just a partial form and all ledger dollars are hypothetically convertible to them).The framing of ""control"" applies to the underlying collateral, which need not change hands to have a valid claim over.This makes it very difficult to measure the debt and funding involved. The balance sheets show only the final outcome of a series of swap and forward transactions. As the box outlines, this shows as an apparent currency mismatch. For instance, if a bank swaps its home currency for dollars, its dollar assets end up exceeding its dollar liabilities. Moreover, for highly active dealer banks, the balance sheet shows only the net result of a possibly huge number of deals for dealer banks very active in the market.More stress on the fact that these tools for moving money are really for manipulating balance sheets. Dealers are less constrained by off balance sheet activity.The dollar reigns supreme in FX swaps and forwards. Its share is no less than 90% (Graph 2), and 96% among dealers (Table 1). Both exceed its share in denominating global trade (about half) or in holdings of official FX reserves (two thirds). In fact, the dollar is the main currency in swaps/forwards against every currency. For instance, it predominates in forwards in the Norwegian krone, the Swedish krona and the Polish zloty, currencies that trade in the spot market more against the euro.6/This is key. The dollar is a global unit. It denominates the bulk of global trade. The amount of those dollars is well beyond the ability of the Fed to measure.. and are disconnected from Fed reserve levels.FX swaps were a key part of non-US banks‚Äô total US dollar funding, amounting to an estimated $0.6 trillion, roughly 6% of the total in March 2017 (Graph 4). The rest, about $9.4 trillion, mostly took the form of deposits from US and non-US non¬≠banks (red and blue areas), and dollar debt securities (yellow area)Who, then, lends dollars to non-US banks via the FX swap market? Four candidates are: US banks, central banks, European agencies and supranational organisations, and private non-banks. All of these appear to provide some funding, with US banks and central banks together closing about half the gapNote the language here, and the attempt to tie dollar funding to the US and central banks. It's a guess (""candidates"", and ""appear""s), and even generously.. dollar funding originating from the US only approaches half of the total. In reality... it's far less.Dollar funding is provided by the broader wholesale global market. It is the activity of all banks, bank-like institutions, dealers, across the world. It is often called shadow banking, or the eurodollar market......Anyway, getting to why Bitcoin would not be adopted by banks for global funding activities:It isn't necessarily a matter of regulation, or the encumbrance of legacy reporting systems. It's that Bitcoin doesn't allow for the flexibility (chicanery) of the current ledger system.The current monetary system has evolved in such a way as to be dependent upon bypasses to ensure continued ability to supply dollars globally.The commercial banking system relies on accounting ""tricks"", and their perceptions of risk to manage money.... and one doesn't even need to point to 2007/8 to prove they've been irresponsible in both areas.A hard ledger precludes this.",20 hours ago,u/nottobetakenesrsly,12,1 comment

How to wind down BlueWallet (noncustodial),"I currently run an LND routing node, and also have BlueWallet set up with a sub-set of the funds from that node (on chain and lightning wallets in BlueWallet, using LND Hub). I'd like to stop using BlueWallet and switch to Zeus, but I'm unclear what needs to be done, if anything, to ""close out / cash out"" Bluewallet.I never really understood what LND Hub actually does. Is it literally just an accounting system where I don't even need to cash out of BlueWallet? If I just uninstall the app, are all the funds sitting on my routing node anyway, or do I have to first drain both the on-chain and lightning wallet within Bluewallet by sending them to my node directly prior to uninstall of the BlueWallet app?To be clear I'm not using BlueWallet's node that's being retired, I'm using my own node via LNDHub. Thanks for any clarification!As an aside - BlueWallet's actually a great wallet, as is Zeus. I switched from Zeus to BW back when I was trying to be a larger routing node and I didn't want Zeus fully controlling the entire node's hot wallet from my phone. Now that the Lightning Network is more established and I can't hang with modern routing nodes anyway, I've paired down my funds and now want to go back to controlling the whole balance with Zeus.",23 hours ago,u/Subfolded,13,3 comments

We have the ability to download the blockchain from satellites.We fight hard to keep the blocksize down so that we can maintain decentralization and keep bandwidth requirements low.Our reaction is more akin to the squirrel who saved up his nuts for winter shaking his head at those who never bothered to prepare.Bitcoiners always expect attacks and always prepare for them.Meanwhile, most of these alt-coins do not have a cypherpunk ethos. They are highly centralized. They hard-fork on a constant basis. Nodes run on AWS and blockchains are so large no one fully validates them. They have centralized authority figures, foundations, corporations, and even marketing departments.We spent a decade telling people they needed to think defensively and they all laughed at us, confident in their technical superiority.This moment is a giant ""I told you so"".  If the SEC declares bitcoin a security or the US government declares it illegal, bitcoiners won't care.We will treat that as just another attack to overcome. Maybe we all just move to El Salvador.Or we build a mesh network to route traffic.",1 day ago,u/escodelrio,177,38 comments
Exchanges operating in East Africa,I have a friend in Tanzania I had been utilizing localbitcoins to be able to send bitcoin she was able to sell and redeem for local currency. This was both much quicker and less expensive than using the usual moneygram type services. We also usually ended up making a bit of money in the trades because of the differences in BTC rates in CAD vs TZN. With localbitcoins closing down we are having difficulty finding somewhere she can sell her bitcoins for Tanzanian currency.I honestly think remittance payments are one of the first large-scale applications for bitcoin. Finding more effective ways to do this helps with adoption outside of North America and Western Europe.So... does anybody know of exchanges operating in Tanzania/with Tanzanian currency options?,1 day ago,u/mmcleodk,6,18 comments

Idea for a Bitcoin credit card service. Is there anything like this?,"So, we all know about overcollateralized loans, what about integrating them into a (physical and/or virtual) credit card service?

Spoke to a Wells Fargo risk analyst about his thoughts on BTC....,"Spoke to a Wells Fargo risk analyst who's a family friend high up in the organization. I was a bit disappointed with his logical response about bank adoption of BTC. He wasn't anti crypto by any means but he told me the following....Big banks move so much money buying and selling bonds, equities, Forex, repo markets etc. that just the SHEER AMOUNT involved in each these transactions automatically triggers slow legacy financial reporting procedures. So in short it doesn't matter that BTC can be sent ""at the speed of light"" as Michael Saylor touts (and BTW I'm a huge Saylor fan).So essentially until regulation clears the way for institutional sized transaction levels without having them slowed down by legacy paper trails this will continue to be a regulatory obstacle that ""slows down"" adoption as well as transaction volumes from big legacy players.Just never thought about this from a banks point of view.... Even if they want to buy and move Bitcoin around. I know that Tesla had to make SEC filings for their BTC purchases for example which is why I have SEC alarms set for Tesla postings.

Owning Bitcoin is a right. You don't need government permission to do so.,"Gary Gensler, the chairman of the SEC, just confirmed that in his eyes, Bitcoin is different. You have Bitcoin on one side and cryptocurrencies on the other. If you're a Bitcoiner, this won't surprise you, because we've all been saying for a long time that Bitcoin != Crypto.But it's always interesting for those who haven't yet figured out the why of Bitcoin to hear someone representing the SEC state this truth: Bitcoin != Crypto.The implications of what Gary Gensler just said are significant because it means that future SEC attacks on the cryptocurrency industry will not target Bitcoin. Bitcoin cannot be attacked by the SEC. Gary Gensler knows this, and he says so.Obviously, since the price of Bitcoin on the spot market is driven by human psychology and emotions, you may still see the price of Bitcoin impacted downward with every announcement of an attack on the cryptocurrency industry by the SEC or another US authority.But in the long run, it does confirm that Bitcoin is here to stay and that Bitcoin is where you should turn if you are really looking to protect the fruits of your labor.In addition to this statement by Gary Gensler, you should also be aware of another important fact. Many institutions are waiting for more clarity on what the SEC plans to do in relation to Bitcoin. If the SEC confirms what Gary Gensler is saying, then it means that the CFTC would probably be the one to take over the potential regulation of Bitcoin.Once this is clearly established, you can expect a massive influx of capital from institutions into Bitcoin.As an individual, this is not something that should worry you too much in my opinion. Indeed, Bitcoin is there to give you back the power over the fruits of your labor in a censorship-resistant way by protecting you from inflation.Owning Bitcoin is a right, and you don't basically need government permission to do so.The sooner you understand this, the better off you will be, because you will be able to save in Bitcoin, and then little by little, do everything to live in Bitcoin. There is still a long way to go, but the goal is clear: the hyperbitcoinization of the world.Time is on Bitcoin's side. And no one will be able to stop the Bitcoin revolution from going its way as long as the people continue to support it.",2 days ago,u/sylsau,56,15 comments

Bitcoin was built for this fight,"Crypto enthusiasts are upset by Gary Gensler's reassertion that he sees bitcoin as a commodity and everything else as an unregistered security. They fear SEC regulation but fail to realize that if their favorite crypto projects were truly decentralized, regulators wouldn't be able to do shit about them.Sure, they could shut down the on/off ramps, make tax laws unfavorable, hell...even make ownership illegal for everything (bitcoin included). But you know what they can't do to bitcoin that they can do to crypto? Go straight to the creators, the foundations, or the companies who are responsible for creating and maintaining it. They can't reverse the network effect that bitcoin has already established or convince the die hard bitcoiners to stop believing in it. If anything, any attempted regulation of bitcoin would only add fuel to the fire and embolden bitcoiners to fight back that much harder.Bitcoin is literally built for this fight and its users are aware of what's at stake, our monetary freedom. We're willing to go down with the ship but we also know our ship ain't going down. Crypto, on the other hand, isn't built for this fight...it's weak centralized garbage and its days are numbered.",2 days ago,u/DestructorEFX,133,46 comments

What is the advantage of mining Bitcoin?,"I am conducting a study on Bitcoin mining, and by extrapolating some  information, based on the graphs I created using information about the  Bitcoin Blockchain provided by NASDAQ, I realized that even if the price  followed the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart and with the network hashrate  increasing proportionally to what has been increasing in recent years,  the profits of 1 TH/s in mining will decrease significantly over time,  reaching the point of being irrelevant in less than 10 years, where the cost of electricity will likely be higher than the gains for that kWh consumed by the miner to provide that 1 TH/s of power to the network. Therefore, it is not worth mining in the long run. Is this correct? What is the advantage of mining in the long run? Would it be to earn transaction fees, hoping that Bitcoin will grow to a point where the fees compensate for mining? Look those graphs:Quantity of Bitcoin and Quantity of Bitcoin Mined per DayNetwork Hashrate and DifficultyPrice and Its Prediction with Rainbow Chart and Mining Reward and Its Prediction with Rainbow ChartBased on what I have seen in these graphs, I believe that if a person  has the money to invest in mining equipment, so it is better for them to take that money and buy Bitcoin, because if the price follows the  Rainbow Chart, they will have more profit with that money than by mining  itself (I didn't even consider the mining pool fees in all of this).",2 days ago,u/herrPortilho,0,31 comments

An old article on hyperinflation and dollar collapse,"TLDR; Article from 2009. An autodidact ""Austrian economist"", almost getting a full picture... good points made along the way.At the time, goldbugs were proclaiming doom due to reserves being ""massively printed"" by the Fed. This article presented a critique of that position.The article title is incendiary (and meant to disabuse the goldbugs of their claims at the time, not as an eternal pronouncement), and of course... this is fully American in viewpoint. I'll add notes as someone who works in the global banking industry.----going long.I get a lot of emails and questions from readers and friends about whether I think the U.S. Dollar could collapse and start a bout of terrible hyperinflation. The questions are usually stemmed from watching an interview on TV with extremely biased energy/gold analysts. People who have every reason to sell you on hyperinflationary doom in order to make themselves a quick buck. I have no respect for these people, so I will not publish their names. They know who they are. I call them the ""opportunistic hyperinflationists.""But there is another group of ""inflationists"" who I do respect greatly. Guys like Peter Schiff, Jim Rogers, Doug Casey and Jim Puplava. These guys have spent years, if not decades, railing against the growing debt bubble and warning that it would end badly. A large faction of the Austrian School of Economics (of which I consider myself a student) had been doing the same. They are the ""ideological hyperinflationists.""I would put many bitcoiners in this camp as well.However, this group of economists/pundits/analysts have been terribly wrong in predicting how this debt bubble would unfold. And I am certain that they will continue to be wrong as it continues and reaches its ultimate conclusion.Ignoring US debt's collateral characteristics means missing a big part of the problem.Typically, these folks have a fundamental dislike of our current system of currency. The feel it is immoral, illegal by the U.S. constitution and is doomed to failure as all paper currencies have been since the beginning of civilization. I agree with them on all counts. But as a function of their dislike for paper money, they have been enchanted by its most obvious replacement: gold. They carry it around with them and flash it at interviews. They become walking salesmen for the return to a gold standard. And they point to a rising price of gold as proof that they have been right all along.They haven't and aren't.Their arguments are usually the same. That in order for the massive amounts of debt to be repaid, the Federal Reserve and other central banks are going to have to resort to monetizing that debt via the ""printing press."" Their claims are well documented. Even the chairman of the Federal Reserve has promised to do this, should it prove necessary, earning him the nickname ""Helicopter Ben"" (after promising to drop money from helicopters to prevent deflation). And it appears he has already started. We can see it in their own figures. By now, I'm sure all of my readers are familiar with the Monetary Base ""Hockey Stick"" graph below that shows how the Fed has essentially doubled the monetary base in just a few short months. This, claim the inflationists, is visual evidence that hyperinflation is already occurring and will inevitably start showing up in everyday prices:The graph will show the reserve levels. Which would have been hockey stick'ed at the time. As I've implied in other posts, domestic reserve levels don't really correlate to global dollar supply.It's relatively easy to demonstrate given reserve levels were historically low throughout the greatest inflationary decades of the United States... or by looking at Japan's decades long QE regime (reserve creation), that failed to push up inflation.First and foremost is the apparent misunderstanding of the differences between money and credit.And here is where the author will make some misteps.At times, they may appear to have the same characteristics. At other times they act completely opposite from one another. As an economy is expanding, an increase in the total amount of credit would appear to have the same effect as an increase in physical dollars because credit is widely accepted as an equal to money. In a sense, they are the same. They are both ""fiduciary media"" (in english they are both a representation of something else, rather than having intrinsic value themselves).Units that are created via credit are indistinguishable from any other denomination claim. ""Money"" is what it has always trended towards; a ledger system (which implicitly creates credit - a topic worthy of it's own post; a difference between traditional ledgers and Bitcoin).But when the economy is contracting, the prospect of default is thrown into the equation. When this happens, money increases in value relative to credit. Money is more valuable than credit because in the event of default, the physical dollar holders are king. Yes, the U.S. treasury could default on it's obligations. Holders of treasury bonds would get a big, fat zero, while holders of physical currency would still have a claim. In effect, they act similar to a preferred share as opposed to common stock. They are a step above in terms of priority.Except that it doesn't. As stated earlier, a ""credit generated"" unit is indistinguishable from some fabled ""primal, non-credit"" unit. In reality, ""money"" is the aggregation of the balance sheets of global banks.As for physical notes being more valuable than ""credit units""; the author will soon unknowingly suggest why they might not be. It has something to do with the fact that physical note issuance comprises the smallest portion of ""money"". This is not ""rarity"" to maintain value.. but ""rarity"" due to non-usefulness.It is often said that we live with a ""fiat currency"" or with ""paper money."" This is not entirely accurate. A very small portion of our total supply of money and credit is in the form of physical currency. It depends on how you count it, but regardless, it is under 10% of the total. This is what differentiates our monetary system with that of Zimbabwe or Weimar Germany circa 1920's. Their economies were based on nearly 100% physical currency because nobody would accept the promises of government in order to issue credit.Because who would want that?.The vast majority of our money supply is in the form of electronic credit. Electronic credit can be destroyed, while physical notes issued by a central bank cannot. This is why deflation is possible in a credit based monetary system, but not in a paper based monetary system.Ok, back on track. Credit is money.There are hundreds of trillions of dollars floating around the world in credit. Much of that is an insurance contract on top of another insurance contract, on top of a securitized mortgage, on top of an asset. The total value of all the aggregate claims on the asset vastly outnumber the value of the asset itself. That is what this crisis is about at its very heart. Picture an inverse pyramid with assets occupying the bottom bit, securitized mortgages in the middle, and credit derivatives at the top. A stable economy would have a right-side-up pyramid with assets occupying the bottom, etc.Yes. This does gloss over a great deal of complexity. The question of the size of the collateral multiplier (or if we should even have one), isn't reducible to an inverted pyramid analogy - but I agree that the system up to 2008 was unstable and operated with false certainty......and may be worse now.Our problem now, is not that the assets are going to go to zero. It's the value of the much larger derivatives and mortgages that back the assets going to zero. Their values were derived from faulty computer models that grossly underestimated risk in the underlying asset, but more importantly in the ability for a counterparty to make good on their promise in the event of a default.I like the dig at VaR (Value at Risk). I would go further... derivatives, swaps, repo, etc. perform a different function for wholesale banking than one of ""investment""; They are balance sheet tools.All are used to manipulate risk-weightings and provisions for credit loss - shifting balance sheet entries. They allow commercial banks to expand their balance sheets (and create more money by doing so).I would say that our problem is one of collateral (and maybe the best reason to re-think things). We have a global ledger system: the interconnected balance sheets of the commercial banks of the world. Uncertainty and perceptions of risk create demand for safe and liquid collateral which underpins how these balance sheets interact. US dollar debt instruments have always been the go-to collateral for the system... and what would happen if confidence in those instruments is questioned?So the next time you hear that the Federal Reserve is ""printing money,"" please do not automatically assume that they are printing physical notes. They are creating electronic reserves (credit) to support the balance sheets of the big banks. There is absolutely nothing inflationary about this. The banks are simply taking it and using it to cancel out their derivative losses or are hoarding it in order to prepare for future losses. Previously, banks would have used the electronic reserves to go out and make 10x that amount in loans to consumers or businesses (in reality the order was the other way around - loans first, then reserves). That is not the case anymore, and until the bad assets are completely liquidated, it will not be the case again.Yes. But also, reserves from the Fed are only useful to banks under the Fed's jurisdiction. The dollar is the unit of the global banking system. Reserves are used for domestic settlement, domestic interbank transfers.And yes, loans first then reserves... that was the typical order. This was until reserves weren't required (and that was long before the Fed reduced to reserve requirement to 0%). Banks used the previously mentioned tools to manipulate their balance sheets to allow for further lending in spite of reserve requirements (something the author misses). Reserves do not make commercial banks lend.Thus far, we have a total of $9.7 Trillion dollars in total government/central bank assistance in the United States. An amount equal to that and more has been provided by their counterparts around the world. More is promised. But the fact remains that the minimal inflationary impact these actions have are negligible in comparison to the amount of ""problem assets"" being devalued around the world. Much of it is just in guarantees - that is, more insurance. The Federal Reserve will offer to swap good assets for bad. All this does is cancel out debt from somewhere else. It's like moving money from one pocket to another. The act of putting money in your right pocket does not make you any richer.It's was never ""swapping"" good assets for bad. It was the movement of collateral. The perception of the collateral changed. What was deemed ""low risk"" yesterday, became ""high risk"" overnight due to perceived correlation. In reality, many of the ""bad"" assets continued to perform and were sold at a profit (unknowable at the time).All in all, the central banks are not nearly as powerful as they'd have you believe. The amount of the total money supply that is controlled by them is minimal. They won't tell you that. They'd prefer you to think that just by them moving their lips they can affect the entire economy's decision making processes. It simply ain't so.Most definitely.Closely tied to the belief in imminent hyperinflation and a skyrocketing gold price is the misplaced belief that the U.S. Dollar is on the brink of collapse. Essentially, they are one and the same. Many of my arguments against hyperinflation are the same against a dollar collapse. But there is even more evidence stacked against such an occurrence.Ultimately, the Dollar will end up at zero - but that is not going to happen any time soon, and I would argue is likely decades away. Until then, the massive amounts of deleveraging will increase our appetite for dollars to pay back debt. There is too much credit in the system, and as we rid ourselves of it slowly, we need to acquire dollars. A large portion of the credit derivatives I mentioned above are denominated in dollars even though the underlying asset may be priced in another currency. This is a theoretical short position on the dollar. A ""carry trade"" in other words. It must be unwound, just like the Yen carry trade.The issue with traditional ledgers, is not only that they allow for credit... They can erase the line between money and credit. Same misconception as highlighted at the beginning - they are the same ""dollars"".This is what is meant when we call the U.S. Dollar the world's ""reserve currency."" Most people hear the word ""reserve"" and automatically conclude that because many other countries hold the dollar as their primary currency in their foreign exchange ""reserves,"" that is what is meant by ""reserve currency."" It is not. Total foreign exchange reserves of dollars are far smaller than total foreign credit contracts denominated in U.S. Dollars (reserves worldwide are ""only"" ~4.6 Trillion). It is the reserve currency because it is the default currency for international trade and commerce in general. In order for that to change, 100's of trillions in contracts would need to be re-written. Not practical.As such, demand for U.S. Dollars will persist.In summary, there are many multiples more debt than capital in the world economy. Debt is being liquidated and will continue to do so until it reaches a sustainable level relative to capital. The process of this debt liquidation puts a higher value on dollars relative to debt, thus ensuring an oversupply of dollars is impossible.I would put it differently. I disagree that an oversupply is impossible. However, the demand for dollars is agnostic to whether they are generated by credit or not. In reality, virtually all dollars are credit originated.We are headed in a bad direction, but it will persist as long as the dollar is the denomination of the global banking system... and as long as USD denominated debt remains prime collateral.",2 days ago,u/nottobetakenesrsly,21,12 comments

Are Maxis 100% Certain They're Right? How to shake 'BTC doubt'?,"This post might get dismissed for incoherent ramblings.I don't know if I'm naturally still a BTC skeptic. I want to move towards being a maxi. I already refer to myself as a maxi but I don't know if I'm telling the complete truth. Are maximalists 100% certain that stacking Bitcoin is an intelligent decision now, or is 99% enough to qualify?I've read a large plethora of resources on btc. I'm still not set on BTC in relation to the human condition. For instance, the general rejection of the unkown by most people, and how easily public opinion is swayed by the powerful in media and our kleptocratic, plutocratic governments.Personally, whilst I was in the process of internalising 'not your keys, not your coins' last year, I got stung in Celsius collapse. I had just withdrawn all of my BTC before the collapse (thankfully) but a couple of shitcoins got stuck. If and when I get anything back, I'll liquidate instantly and buy more btc. All of my holdings are in cold storage now.But I keep stacking sats, and the doubt is still there, what if this is all for nothing. From a personal investment standpoint as a young person, my brain wants to just DCA into tried-and-tested index funds, not btc, as much as I would love societal BTC adoption to continue on an uptrend.I wonder if this sort of illogical fear is due to my negative experience with Celsius (I know, shameful, idiotic, disgusting, I hate myself for it). But, also I can never seem to eradicate the doubt, so that leads me to thinking I have some sort of subconscious illogical trauma from Celsius which is preventing me from becoming more comfortable with Bitcoin again, despite the two concepts being entirely unrelated.",2 days ago,u/03Oliver,73,156 comments

There should be no correlation between mining difficulty and price,"Someone posted That Bitcoin Mining difficulty hit a new ATH and I always see people talking about how Bitcoin price Will follow and increase as well. I dont see the connection. Maybe someone can explain what is going on.My thoughts: There is always a predictable amount of freshly mined Bitcoin per time on the market regardless the mining difficulty. Why should the market care about the involved mining costs? Bitcoin doesnt get more rare because of It. When there are more miners, the difficulty increases and when there are less miners, It decreases. When miners stop operating, there is no loss of supply. The amount of mined Bitcoin per time stays the same so the amount of fresh Bitcoin hitting the markets also stays the same.When we compare It to gold mining, its logical that an increase in mining difficulty and mining costs can indeed result in a decrease of supply per time. When its too expensive to mine gold, there is nothing that Will magically decrease the difficulty of gold mining so miners stopping to operate is a real loss of new supply per time which Will make It more rare and can result in price increase.The only thing comparable to that is Bitcoin halving which decreases Bitcoin supply and make it more rare. those events indeed showed a price increase of Bitcoin which is logical when there is suddenly only half the amount of new Bitcoin per time available on market.One argument that I found is that more miners can mean a more secure Network which make Bitcoin itself more valuable. But i kinda doubt This Will have such an impact at This point to be honest. At least not like the price increases due to decrease of supply.",3 days ago,u/Extra-Confection-706,6,23 comments

Electrum X server,"I wanted to use my own node for broadcasting bitcoin transactions.

For some reason I am unable to connect with Phoenix.I haven't tried any other wallets.If anyone wants to use an Electrum server to interface with the bitcoin network, you can find one at https://btc.arnzenarms.com:50002I can't seem to find a list anywhere of all the electrum compatible bitcoin wallets so I can't test them.This is a non-custodial server. It is only a gateway to the bitcoin network. It should allow you to do things like check your balance and broadcast transactions. Every wallet you use connects either to a node you control directly via RPC or through something like this server.Most wallets will connect to a somewhat centralized server (eg. Ledger) or possibly a random electrum server (eg. Phoenix). This process leaks a little privacy since the server knows the IP making the requests, but the rest of the data is publicly available on the blockchain. Though the IP can be obfuscated using Tor or a VPN.If you don't want to run your own server, and like the idea of a gun store's server processing your bitcoin transactions.

Hardwarewallets used by redditors,"In many postst and comments in this forum people reccomend using hardwarewallets for storing Bitcoin which I, like most bitcoiners, fully support. However when it comes to the different hardwarewallets that people here use and reccomend, its mostly ledger, coldcard and trezor. The bitbox is almost never mentioned. However from other scourses like Youtube, the bitbox 02 (Bitcoin only Edition) appeares to be the most reccomend  option for storing btc. Is the bitbox 02 pushed by german youtubers (like Roman Eher and Niko Jilch) or is it fine and maybe undertepresented in this forum? Has anyone tried the bitbox and can reccomend it or has any complains? I personally tested the ledger nano s and the bitbox 02. Both are fine in my opionion. I dont like the ledgers partly closed source policy and the storage of customer data. And I dont like the lack of haptical feedback of the bitbox 02. Other than that I am happy with both but like the bitbox better.",3 days ago,u/Pain-Parking,8,8 comments

Bitcoin is already better than gold and wire transfers. Why not to push the narrative on this fact to start?,"We all know Bitcoin is way more than gold 2.0, but basing on the current state of the art (high fees and verification waiting time), the network is not (yet) capable of fully substitute FIAT as a time/cost efficent medium of exchange.That said, BTC can already outperform metals as a store of value and the FIAT system as a medium of exchange for large amounts. With an average cost of 1,80$ per fee and a 10mins average for payment delivery, the Bitcoin Network can fully replace conventianal investment assets like gold and silver with nothing but advantages, and also be a more reliable and efficent way to send large quantities of money wherever/whenever/to whoever needed, as opposed to the traditional banking system.So why is people so reluctant, at least this is my impression, to promote Bitcoin as a substitute for gold or wire transfers? High volatility is obviously something one doesn't want to deal with when talking about saving purchasing power, but after all this is ""just"" a matter of adoption.If the ecosystem was more eterogenous and wide, whales wouldn't be able to have such an impact on fluctuations as they have now. This is exactly why metals prices are more stable than BTC.I've always thought that the main problem of the Bitcoin industry is the lack of a coordinated (not centralized) marketing and promotion net, with the ambition of tackling on/debunking the mainstream narrative. What we have achieved until now is just an annuity life on the undeniable disrupting features of this technology, a passive approach. I'd like to see more ""aggressiveness"" for those about presence on media, sponsorships and promotion. Something professionally managed.We, the Bitcoiners, need to talk to people in a different way, addressing more tangible facts already observable, rather than the future prospects inherent to Bitcoin mass adoption.Not saying YOU should do it, I'm saying the Bitcoin Organization, for example, should.",4 days ago,u/Rajang7,26,16 comments

"Let's Talk About ""FUD"" )Not what you think... )","Let's talk about the term ""FUD"".I think the reaction of calling every idea about about Bitcoin you don't like as ""FUD"" is ridiculous.  It's the same intelectual laziness by which liberals attribute any type of disadvantage to racism or sexism and the way conservatives dismiss any information that doesn't align with their world view as fake news.They are all just excuses of self-righteous defensiveness.I know even the biggest Bitcoin influences throw this term around, but I would urge you to have deeper thoughts when questioned about bitcoin. By not leaning on the knee-jerk reaction of ""FUD"" you will provide a better understanding to the person asking the question and it will also force you to deepen your own understanding and philosophy of why Bitcoin works.And that is exactly why the term is unnecessary and lazy, because all the typical arguments ""FUD"" against bitcoin have very clear explanations that anyone willing to learn how money works can easily understand. And if that person doesn't what to take the time to understand bitcoin, that's fine. They will just have to buy bitcoin at the price they deserve.I've often posted here that Bitcoin does not care about semantics, but I think this idea is more than just semantics. It's about promoting a more intelligent discussion around bitcoin, which also requires the respondent to also improve their own understanding.Cheers!",4 days ago,u/donmulatito,3,46 comments

Confession: I hate Bitcoin...but...,"For years now, I've been anti-crypto.  I've called it a Ponzi...I've compared it to tulips...I've found pleasure in the markets grinding down over the past year.  I've hated all the cryptards with their rocket emojies and asking ""wen moon?"".  I'm a metal stacker.  I love gold and silver.  But despite all of this, I just bought some Bitcoin, and here's why.First off, I want to give a shout out to my man Jerry on Youtube.  He too is a metal stacker.  He too is a patriot.  But unlike me before today, he owned Bitcoin and considers himself a Bitcoin ambassador.While I still do not think that Bitcoin has intrinsic value, it's not really the intrinsic value that is important here.  Like gold and silver and other hard assets, the premise behind Bitcoin is to opt out of the ""doll hair"" system.  Objectively, it makes little to no sense to hold any substantial amount of money in cash/dollars.  The government excess and debt policy will inevitably fail.  This is a massive alignment with the metals community, and common ground on which I can build.And though I love metals, we do and will continue to live in a digital age.  The longer I've stacked metals, the more obvious it has become that that we will not transact in metals again.  Bitcoin makes me uneasy because I cannot physically touch it, but I see its transaction value.  And while I do foresee CBDCs and overregulation/restriction by the government, metals and Bitcoin together can provide a risk-diversified portfolio that enables individuals to protect their wealth from multiple possible scenarios that spell doom for the dollar.For that reason, I will be moving towards a 50/50 metals/Bitcoin portfolio outside of 401k/Roth/HSA investments.  All other income not directed to tax-advantaged accounts will go to metals and Bitcoin (and no other crypto).  Diversification is important as we must prepare for all outcomes.  We do not know how long the dollar system will remain, thought we do know that it is eventually going to fall and must prepare for that, as well.Anyway, this is a long-winded way to say, I've spent a lot of time shitting on crypto, and most of that is still valid.  However, there is a laudable goal in Bitcoin, despite the clownery of the rest of the crypto world.  There is greed in every asset, but many of us are just trying to make it through the awful mess we see coming.  Thank you.",5 days ago,u/ConfidentialMetals,327,294 comments

Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized money of the future. And yet it will fail and get centralized eventually.,"Yeah I said it. But it's for a completely different reason than you might think.Let's go straight up sci-fi:It's April 20th, year 2420. The Empire of Mankind finished terraforming Mars almost a century ago and you are living there. You send a video message to your mom, and leave for lunch. Right now the distance from Earth to Mars is the average 225 million kilometers, so the message will reach her in about twelve minutes. She has to record her own message, that will take her about ten minutes. And then twelve minutes that her message travels back to you. That's 35 minutes before she'll respond. Hell 25 minutes is the absolute minimum thanks to speed of light.You might already know where this is going.The Bitcoin block time is ten minutes. Each new block is based in the previous one (hash). That means to be at least slightly capable of mining BTC you need to be within ten light minutes away from from the propagating nodes of the previous block to be able to receive info necessary to calculate the new block before someone within the distance does it before your machine. Average distance from Earth to Mars and Venus is 12.6 and 3.75 light minutes respectively. That time is what you are losing mining wise compared to those physically closer to the machine that mined the previous block. Oh yeah, and if you calculate the block you still have to deliver the block to other nodes to get them confirm your block. Good luck beating the laws of physics. The Earth is now the 'central mining bank' of the interstellar financial world of The Empire of Mankind thanks to speed of light limiting it's spread.Edit:love the immediate downvote from the guy who just read the title lol.",5 days ago,u/Blbe-Check-42069,0,43 comments

Spitballing Ideas: The Churn,"I got this idea, maybe I'm off my rocker but just want to get feedback:Its called BBB (Bitcoin Billions Bonds) - or 'the triple B'High-level overview - consolidate bitcoin from millions of users into single wallet/address, use that bitcoin to purchase the equivalent amount in boring 3-4% treasury bonds, take that interest from the bond yield and buy bitcoin.user consolidated bitcoin --> [buy] Treasury Bonds -- Bond yield [interest] ---> [buy] bitcoinThis is the concept of Churning, fiat interest into BitcoinThat is the basic overview, but from the bitcoin purchased from yield interest, you can continue on with the bitcoin purchase from the bond yield to do many other interesting things:Accumulate the yield interest bitcoin for a year, then evenly split the accumulated bitcoin back among the user addresses that pooled the original bitcoin to purchase the bonds.Take the accumulated bitcoin purchased through bond yield, split it by an specific number and randomly send it back to the original users who pooled their bitcoin to purchase the bonds. Once an address receives a payout it is removed, and the process continues.use the bond yield interest to buy bitcoin, then funnel that bitcoin into other smart contracts as dictated by the pool users.Assumptions: You'd need a company that can take the pooled bitcoin from millions of user addresses ( so ideally billions worth of bitcoin), buy bonds and then take the yield to buy back bitcoin. Ideally the company would be as automated as possible (if maybe not entirely) and auditable. Maybe it can be collectively owned by the users themselves.Also if the pooled users decide or if dictated in a smart contract, the bonds can be liquidated and bitcoin purchased and that amount returned in proportion/ or equally back to the original creators of the that pool.Am I mental or does this concept have any value?",5 days ago,u/Penguin_PC,0,8 comments

on bitcoins incentive structure...,"probably the best thing about bitcoin (i know i  know thats coming in hot) is that it fixes the broken fiat incentive structure.  some years ago i was reading some literature about buddhism and one thing that impressed me was a bit about incentive structures.  according to buddhism, people will act in their own self interest most, if not all, of the time.  but what does that mean 'to act in your own best interest'?  for someone who is dying of thirst, they will be looking to get some water.  for someone who has nothing to eat and is cold they are going to be incentivized to get nourishment and clothing and shelter, and on and on.  but what buddhism teaches is that once a person is somewhat enlightened and they have their immediate needs met, if this individual is on the right track to 'enlightenment' (whatever that means), then they will be incentivized to help their fellow man.  this is because they get joy and satisfaction from helping others.  right?  who doesn't like to help someone out who needs help, it makes you feel good as well as helping that person.  emphasis on having that good feeling when helping others, as i read it you are on the way to enlightenment if you have trained yourself to feel good when helping other people in need.  that individuals incentive structures are lined up meaning that helping people gives them joy as well as helping to improve the community they belong to.  helping others brings that person joy and in a sense is a selfish act, because they will be getting a sweet dopemine high through helping another person.  now a cynical person may say that this individual is not doing anything good since their so-called kind acts are really a way to get a fix of sweet sweet dopamine, but i disagree.  if i like to fish no one is going to call me selfish for spending my time and money going fishing.  so if i like to give out sats on the internet, who's to say that makes me selfish?with fiat, our incentives are to enrich ourselves at all costs.  because you just never know how much is enough.  you have a million dollars and can retire? Wrong! didnt you get the memo? a million dollars aint shit no more, back to work for you! go get your flare on and write up some TPS reports post haste!  all that money you have?  better spend it on consumerist bullshit because if you dont you are losing money through inflation.  And that is on the individual level dont even get me started on the political level.  in politics,  acting fiscally responsible is a death sentence.  so we have the most powerful people being the least fiscally responsible and it's no surprise the guns come real real fuckin fast.  and the pooerst amoung us pay the costs for the rich and powerfuls fucking problems.  fiats incentive structure is fucked up.in bitcoin, the more that others thrive the more the rest of us thrive.  for us bitcoiners adoption should be the paramount thing.  if you have all the bitcoins in the world then their not worth a pot to piss in because nobody else has any.  if you are a wholecoiner and bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency you have more than you will ever need.  dragons hoarding treasure is the fiat model (or maybe the gold bug model peter shiff if your reading this).  matter of fact, dragons hoarding treasure is almost antithetical to what we need to be doing.  money need to be spent helping others thereby helping the network, and it aligns with the buddists idea about how being enlightened means being incentivized to help others on a deeply personal level.  bitcoins incentive structure is far superior.in summary, i give away bitcoin on the internet  not because im some bleeding heart, liberal guilt, soy boy, its because i believe it benefits me directly to do so, i enjoy it, i think its important, and i do it because i believe its going to make me rich as fuck (and the rest of you motherfuckers too), deal with it.also, maybe someone who knows about buddhism can let me know if i got that concept right.  i may have been going through a heavy marijuana phase when i was reading that stuff.",5 days ago,u/downtownjj,9,5 comments

I just wanted to encourage more debate in this topic. As we all know owning our own wallet and keeping our seed phrase safe is core to web3. But this is a daunting task. If you ask people to choose between storing money in a bank which guarantees you money back even if the bank goes bankrupt, or storing money in a seed phrase which mean you would lose all your money if you are careless, I believe most people would choose to keep their money in a traditional bank. People do not like to take responsibility, especially when the risk at stake is losing your wealth. So I am wondering what solutions are the space creating for this user experience issue?

"As someone coming from a Political Science/History background, Bitcoin‚Äôs takeover of humanity is inevitable","The wheels of history have been set in motion the past few years, and there is absolutely no hope of turning back. People are going to need to adapt to Bitcoin or starve to death. Or get drafted to die for whatever global war their country‚Äôs international alliance is involved in.Governments are printing infinite trillions of peasant tokens while their citizens starve and WWIII escalates.

The people opposed to the system are now smarter and stronger than the ones running it.Bitcoin is compatible with all political ideologies, especially the extremist ones capable of violence. The concept of being motivated by need rather than greed is central to most religions.

"Crypto Investors have a ""herd-like mentality""","This groundbreaking analysis concludes that lower-Low-income, young males are the most likely to invest in cryptocurrencies. They tend to exhibit ""herd-like behavior,"" investing when prices rise and losing money when they decline; typical behavior during financial bubbles. These latecomers are also the least knowledgeable and least able to withstand losses. These investors also follow a ""hail Mary"" strategy similar to investing in lotteries, making a low probability, high reward bet.

Opinion: The Invasion of Ukraine and the Threat of Central Banks,"The world is currently experiencing a dangerous situation with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the threat of a potential Nuclear war looms. However, this situation is not just about political tensions and military strategy; it also involves the role of central banks, global multinational corporations and the rise of alternative currencies like Bitcoin.  It is no secret that central banks have played a significant role in shaping the global economy, their existence has even been linked to the occurrence of World Wars.Many people are starting to see the current financial system as flawed. The availability of public blockchain technology poses a threat that could make them redundant virtually overnight. Financial institutions make money by lending it. Governments borrow more money for war than anything else. Financial institutions make money by lending money, and they make more money from wars than anything else.No other government has been placed under a larger sanctions package than Russia. Despite these sanctions, the Russian economy has grown. Not only has the Russian economy grown; they're now selling oil for Rubles, and have created a gold-backed Ruble; the once-failed aspirations of Sadam and Gaddafi. This was made possible after Putin publicly claimed that he was exploring the possibility of selling Russian oil for Bitcoin. Could oil and gold-backed Rubles deter nation-states from following the likes of El Salvador, Japan, Germany, Malta, and others in making Bitcoin legal provisions and legitimacy? Would adding gold-backed rubles to their reserves, be a more attractive alternative to hedging dollars with Bitcoin? Private financial multinationals have offices across multiple jurisdictions that can circumvent government sanctions indirectly for Russian interests.Based on Russia's own economic interests, the primary objective of Russia's invasion of Ukraine is to make Ukraine's admission into Europe/Nato as expensive as possible. In a similar vein to what Nato did to the Societ Union. He can achieve this by destroying its industrial and agricultural assets. Ukraine poses a significant threat to Russia's monopoly on natural gas reserves in the European continent. If Ukraine joins the EU and the EU funds the extraction of their gas, this would destroy Putin's monopoly on it. Additionally, Ukraine competes with Russia on many other major global products, like wheat for example, which would be a huge boon to the EU if Ukraine joined its free trade zone and single market.Russia lacks ports with access to international waterways all year round, as its northern sea border is frozen over for most of the year. This is the main reason why they annexed/invaded Crimea in 2014 and built a naval port in Syria. They now control East Ukraine and a land bridge from Russia to the port of Crimea in Ukraine. Giving mainland Russia and the Russian Navy vital access to international waterways all year round.When we look at their weapons industry; in contrast to the West, Russia and even China have used their military spending (less than 1/10 of what the US spends per year) on state-of-the-art, a-symmetrical technology like hypersonic missiles and SAM systems. Russia has been leading space and rocketry technology since the Space Shuttle was decommissioned; NASA has been paying Roscosmos to do ISS missions for them for over a decade. Russia used this funding to increase its technical knowledge and has since achieved several publicly documented pioneering technologies, demonstrating a capacity to fire MIRVs over longer distances than previously stated, the ability to take out orbiting satellites, and their proliferation of SAM systems.The invasion of Ukraine is extremely expensive, both for Putin and the rest of the world, global inflation is skyrocketing. Governments are taking out huge loans to provide military aid, and Ukraine is getting destroyed. The situation in Ukraine is complex, and it involves political tensions, military strategy, and the role of lending institutions. As we move forward, we must be aware of the potential impact of financial institutions and their fear of alternative currencies, places on global politics and economics. The invasion of Ukraine is just one example of the dangerous consequences that can result from the intersection of these issues.",6 days ago,u/raphaiki,5,3 comments

CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act Bill and its implication (hopium?) for Bitcoin,"Minnesota Congressman Tom Emmer announced on Twitter that he and a few others are going to introduce a bill that would in his words aim to do the following three things:Prohibit the Fed from issuing a CBDC directly to anyone.Bar the Fed from using a CBDC to implement monetary policy and control the economy.Require the Fed's CBDC projects to be transparent to Congress and the American people.The discussion and trajectory around this bill is going to be a historic event for our financial and political infrastructure not just in the US but across the world for decades to come. Expressing the importance for privacy, he states that ""any digital version of the dollar must uphold our American values of privacy, individual sovereignty, and free market competitiveness. Anything less opens the door to the development of a dangerous surveillance tool.""From the view I have of the US government, I would be very surprised and thrilled if any version of this bill passes let alone in its current form. Many powerful governments around the world including UK, India and China have already started piloting their in-house CBDCs and are on path for rampant scaling.CBDCs could potentially be the strongest tool any government has EVER had at its disposal in the history of humanity and this will have shattering implications for all aspects of our lives. The current state of the financial infrastructure is already such that every transaction of ours is monitored in the name of anti-money laundering and tax evasion laws. Should we let them look at all of what we do with our money just because some people out there could be laundering money, evading taxes or performing some illicit activities? Those involved in such activities are already a step ahead and this is also why these people have embraced bitcoin earlier than other segments of population. Despite their illegitimate reasons, the 3 key features for which these shady guys have embraced bitcoin way ahead of the general population are noteworthy - transactions without a central authority/intermediary, decentralization based on cryptographic proof instead of trust and non-kyc/anonymous wallets that preserve privacy.Governments and private banking institutions have already been monitoring our financial lives and all other aspects that associate with it for almost half a century now and have a dataset whose richness and usefulness has been improving dramatically with the advancement of web and technology over the last few years. I'm scared about the possibility of how much this is likely going to improve over the next decade. Unless we actively choose to not be a part of this system and make efforts to tackle and discourage the existing financial and web infrastructure centered around monitoring, our privacy is going to be lost forever.CBDCs would be the last nail in the coffin that we should anyhow avoid and the most prominent way we can do this is by adopting bitcoin not just for the big gains but for the values it embraces with a privatised and predetermined monetary policy that is neutral in its intent by code for a cherry on top. Not just monitoring, it is really important that we disempower the government for controlling the value (money) that we spend all our lives to create. They print it out of thin air and devalue it even with other means at their whims to suit their budget and economic interests. We are in a debt bubble whose existence is primarily only because of the nature of money in its current form. Governments have debt that are multiples of their nation's GDP and corporations largely function on and expand with debt while I'm not able to loan out a year equivalent of my earnings while all of our money is lend out to them atleast 4 times over. How and why are we okay with this? Prices keep rising because of the current monetary, debt and growth environment and we have to keep working harder just so we can sustain our standard of living? Real median income of middle class households have been on a decline while the average per capita has been growing. To me, that is nowhere close to an ideal economic, social and political state and far on the other end of the spectrum. We're doing poorly on all these fronts.Bitcoin is truly the revolution we need because it disempowers monetary shenanigans, debt growth and government control. We employ the government (atleast in a democracy) and need to keep them out of our business and ask them to focus on what we as a society want them to do.Governments have enough money from the taxes they collect, money they print and other magic monetary and fiscal tools they have at their disposal. At the very least, we need to cut out the monitoring for which they have no good reason other than to empower themselves and have us as slaves to their intent. Bitcoin gives us a chance to do this along with a whip on other overreaches that governments have over economic and social structures as well as our personal lives.I'm writing my thoughts down with the hope that we as a community can initiate a serious discussion around the bill tabled, overreaches of the government and the importance of bitcoin so that it's not just the Congress whose intent controls the narrative. Or atleast so that we're clear of the differences and know the areas we need to work on to get the government to do what we expect of them.Governments have already succeeded so far in their fight against bitcoin especially with the way they've got Centralized exchanges to dominate the ecosystem and comply with anti-money laundering laws. I've got thoughts about this I'd like to discuss which I'm keeping for another post so that this one doesn't end up being a soup. Hoping to create a series of posts discussing the developments from the bill tabled and other thoughts I have about the relevant issues.I really hope bitcoin comes out on the winning side a few years/decade down the line and that would only happen if all of us already involved with crypto take up a discussion and talk about the merits with our friends and family. As much as this sub discourages crypto talk in real life, that is the only way we can move foward. Bitcoin is in such a speculative phase that most of its merits are overshadowed in the social narrative by its volatility and hopes for gains/get rich quick scheme. I think all of us need to take responsibility to change that narrative and make efforts to talk about other aspects of bitcoin  with friends and family as much as that comes with the shame/guilt of being deep in the red.Long bitcoin, short the bankers and government-controlled magic money.",6 days ago,u/noob_zarathustra,22,6 comments

The primary assumption/thinking error (for most) is that economic circumstances won't change. After the news of the burning banks and collapsed currency in Lebanon. It really struck me. Bitcoin has become one of the if not the most valuable assets in the country without a change in global sentiment. We are still 70% away from ATH, just chilling at a possible bearmarket bottom in dollars. But in this little country a Bitcoin Holder is wealthier then ever.Bitcoin doesnt have to win by appreciating in price in normal market conditions, it will simply win with the collapse of a FIAT currency. In other words: Bitcoin will win by simply not losing.People love to fantasize about what needs to happen for Bitcoin to become more valueable then it already is, like mass-adoption or another country embrassing it as legal tender. But very little people think about what Bitcoin mustn't do. Which is failing. If it doesn't fail, the cause effect sooner or later will be an astronomical rise in value.Bitcoin's succes and therefore it's price rise will be a result of a failing a system. This makes arguing about today's price, and where it will go under what cicrcumstances so stupid.TLDR; I just realized that if Bitcoin simply doesn't fail, a rise in value is inevitable. Fiat failing in the long or short term will be the cause-effect of exponential value growth. Not mass adoption or an ETF acceptance or the next halving.",6 days ago,u/Supperdjdodo,64,32 comments

Will the same number of satoshis be required for a transaction as that transaction would have previously cost when it was 10k cheaper? Or does the number of satoshis used in a transaction decrease with the increasing cost of bitcoin? Today, my transaction cost is about 2000 sats for a medium-priority transaction.

Bitcoin's stability with fee-only block reward,"Hi yall.Recently there was a post the other day (couldn't find it again) where the author discussed the topic of BTC stability once the fixed block reward become marginal/zero. After reading their post I became curious and looked for more information on the topic. I happened to run into an article written by Pinceton researchers titled ""On the Instability of Bitcoin Without the Block Reward""I would attach the link but I don't want to get flagged for it. Just google the article name it'll be the first one to come up.Anyways: after reading through the article I was definitely shocked by some of the rational miner activity that could occur during that future period. Obviously, no one knows the future and we are very far away from this being a concern, but IMO some of the problems that could face BTC seem legitimately concerning. I encourage the curious and brave to read the abstract and intro (at least) of this article and formulate some opinions of your own. The subject material is very interesting.I would love to hear what you guys think of this research and if their concerns/findings are valid. Personally I'd love to hear some people squash this as FUD, because it definitely has me question some things. Plz let me know your thoughts.I made a summary of the abstract and introduction and this is my objective summary of those respective sections""This paper explores the impact of transaction fees on the security and performance of Bitcoin, particularly as the block reward dwindles over time. While the assumption has been that miners being paid through block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain, the paper argues that this is not the case. With only transaction fees, the variance of the block reward becomes very high due to the exponentially distributed block arrival time, making it attractive for miners to fork a ""wealthy"" block to ""steal"" the rewards therein. This results in an equilibrium with undesirable properties for Bitcoin's security and performance, and even non-equilibria in some circumstances. The paper also revisits selfish mining and shows that it can be made profitable for a miner with an arbitrarily low hash power share, who is poorly connected within the network.The paper discusses the implications of these findings for the future security of Bitcoin and draws lessons for the design of new cryptocurrencies. It provides an illustrative example of how rational, self-interested miners could behave in a block chain with exponentially distributed rewards, revealing novel incentive issues that do not arise when block rewards are fixed. The paper argues that there are new and surprising incentive issues in a transaction-fee regime, even assuming that transactions arrive at a steady rate.The paper's contributions include a mining strategy simulator to fill gaps and confirm theoretical results, as well as a discussion of potential solutions to the incentive issues raised. The paper suggests a variety of possible solutions. These solutions include changes to the protocol, such as increasing block sizes or adjusting fees, or creating alternative cryptocurrencies with different incentive structures.Overall, the paper argues that the assumption that block rewards and transaction fees do not affect the security of the blockchain is incorrect and that further research is necessary to address the incentive issues raised in a transaction-fee regime.Main Points:Transaction fees have a significant impact on the security and performance of Bitcoin as the block reward dwindles over timeThe variance of the block reward becomes very high with only transaction fees, making it attractive for miners to fork a ""wealthy"" block to ""steal"" the rewards thereinSelfish mining can be profitable for a miner with an arbitrarily low hash power share and who is poorly connected within the networkThe paper suggests possible solutions, including changes to the protocol or creating alternative cryptocurrencies with different incentive structures""That is all: keep stacking and tell me your thoughts por favor",7 days ago,u/Cute-Transition-7419,1,11 comments

"The halving keeps moving up because of the ever-increasing hash rate! However, it has started to stabilize with this latest cycle.","Notice that the next halving keeps moving up?  A couple years ago, it was projected to be around late May 2024.  A year ago, it was closer to mid May.  A few months ago, it was early May, and today, it's all the way back to April 29th!Why is this happening?  Basically, the hash rate of the network just keeps going up because better, more efficient ASICs keep getting manufactured.  The Antminer S19 XP for example is 47% more efficient than the Antminer S19, and is now widely available, you can get one on eBay.  As the hash rate increases, the block times average less than 10 minutes.  Because the difficulty adjustment only happens once every 2 weeks, it can go for as long as 2 weeks with shorter blocks before it adjusts and gets the average back to 10 minutes.  But because the hash rate just keeps growing and growing, the difficulty adjustment is constantly playing ""catch up"" and the block times are constantly averaging less than 10 minutes over the years.  This moves the halvings back because each halving is exactly 210,000 blocks apart, which implies exactly 1,458 1/3 days if each block is exactly 10 minutes.  But every 4 years has 1,461 days (assuming a leap year, some 4 year periods would be 1,460 days as they don't have a leap year), so even if it was 10 minutes per block, the halvings would move back by 2 2/3 days per halving.  However, note the movement historically:Genesis block:  January 3, 2009Halving 1:  November 28, 2012                       Days since Genesis Block:  1,425        Diff from 1,461:  -36Halving 2:  July 9, 2016                                      Days since Halving 1:          1,319        Diff from 1,461: -142Halving 3:  May 11, 2020                                  Days since Halving 2:           1,402        Diff from 1,461:  -59Halving 4 (projected):  April 29, 2024             Days since Halving 3:           1,449        Diff from 1,461:  -12So, as you can see, it was the period from 2012-2016 when the network hash rate just grew like crazy, and moved the 2nd halving back by an astounding 142 days, or about 4 2/3 months.  Since then the movement has been less, almost kind of starting to stabilize.  Part of that is because of the China ban on mining, which threw the hash rate off for quite a while and caused the difficulty adjustment to revise downward, which is why the latest halving is only a few days up from the 3rd halving.Anyways, my point is, when you look at the next halving approaching, just keep in mind that the number of days are NOT set in stone, it's the number of blocks.  And that depends on the (ever-increasing) hash rate and difficulty level.  It all means, that the last Bitcoin will NOT be minted in 2140, but likely many years sooner.Stack on and hodl!!!EDIT 1:  Changed the amount at ""moved the 2nd halving back by an astounding 142 days, or about 4 2/3 months...""  Originally it said 3 2/3.",7 days ago,u/RonPaulWasR1ght,7,10 comments

Bitcoin is both a risk on speculative asset and a risk off safe haven asset simultaneously,"It is a risk on speculative technology play based around its potential to become the worlds payment rails disrupting banks SWIFT visa and mastercard.It is a risk off safe haven store of value play based around its sound money characteristics and scarce supply disrupting gold as the superior safe haven asset.During times of risk on speculation bitcoin rises alongside technology stocks and during times of risk off recession, financial crisis, high inflation and market chaos bitcoin will rise along side gold.We know how well bitcoin performs in a risk on speculative mania like 2013 2017 and 2021 but we do not yet know how well it will perform as a superior form of gold, and it is my thinking that its safe haven gains will be far greater than any of its speculative gains seen so far. A safe haven bull run could see gold double to a $25 trillion market cap and bitcoin match golds market cap putting bitcoin at $1.25 million per coin.There is no other asset on earth that has the potential to be both a risk on speculative asset and a risk off safe haven asset simultaneously.

A note on Petrodollars,"From a 2016 piece from the Financial Times. There will be some opinion injected along the way.Moreover, there is a bigger issue still being missed here. The petrodollar story is in fact a eurodollar story, always was and always will be.If fact... there are no Petrodollars.When William Simon (formerly of Salomon Brothers), negotiated with Saudi Arabia, he merely arranged a public relations situation that would disguise Saudi US treasury purchases. Most oil was already priced in dollars, as USD was already the global medium by 1960. A Salomon Brothers banker would have been deeply familiar with the advent of modern banking at the time.Treasuries had already become prime collateral by the 70's. Saudi Arabia was merely pointed towards a pre-existing global banking system... by a banker who just so happened to be working for the government at the time.Oil could, and had been occasionally priced in other denominations; but the most accepted medium remained USD... only rivaled by the pound pre-1950s. Attempting to price oil in any other denomination would have limited the access to buyers as no other denomination had the depth of liquidity to facilitate global trade.And that‚Äôs important because‚Ä¶ eurodollars are in effect nothing more than the original bitcoin. A free-float of dollar-denominated claims whose fractioning is out of the control of the Federal Reserve system or the state, and which is instead supported by the combination of growing US consumption of foreign goods, services and commodities as well as US speculative investment abroad, in exchange for consumption claims on its own system today.What a statement there, eh? (As a note: I don't fully agree with that first bolded section)And again, eurodollars are dollars. The dollar is a global unit.That‚Äôs a complicated way of saying: ""US energy dependency has forced the superpower to share a significant chunk of its wealth with the rest of the world for decades now, a form of underwriting by the richest state in the world which has increased global interconnectedness, global trade and global growth in general.Yes. Being the global reserve, means allowing the globe some degree of control over the medium of exchange. That control is mostly in the hands of the global banking system.And it is this foregone stake which has lubricated the global liquidity system ever since the eurodollar story first began in the 1960s. It‚Äôs also what has empowered the build up of significant foreign current account surpluses, which in themselves represented gigantic shock-absorbing balance sheets for global supply and demand mismatches.Began in the 1950s, maybe slightly earlier. Again, this is the global banking system.The unfortunate irony seems to be that the Fed is tightening policy into a dollar bank run (in Eurodollars, i.e. offshore dollars), while believing that its domestic economy is stronger than it really is, and as banks become less and less willing to extend Eurodollar funding as they constrain balance sheets due to regulation/risk aversion.The Fed does not realize the extent of the global dollar system, preferring a narrow view that matches its toolkit and mandate.Risk aversion as a topic could be a whole other post.In the meantime, however, we have the clear and present danger from more than US$10 trillion of offshore (Euro) dollar debt riddled with currency, maturity and, in some cases, commodity mismatches. Brazil‚Äôs currency has been decimated and its economy is in recession. China is now the focal point of this problem, with in excess of US$1.1 trillion of dollar debt and a further US$0.6-0.9 trillion in Hong Kong (a decent slug of which will have been lent to Chinese corporates).It's more than $10T now.And there's a graphic to portray the balance sheet mechanics of the issue ...which may give further context to monetary problems in China today.That's enough for now. Petrodollars are just global dollars. Most commodities are priced in USD.",8 days ago,u/nottobetakenesrsly,7,15 comments

The case against a bullish halving.,"I am still learning about bitcoin, if anything I say is wrong please correct me.After the last halving we saw a major bullrun. 6k to 69k. Optimistically we could expect then, assuming a bottom is around 16k, a ~180k price. Or even higher.However even though a halving reduces rewards by 50%. That 50% value is 50% as impactful as the last cut.50 btc -> 25 btc -> 12.5 btc -> 6.25 btc ‚Ä¶ etcThis should result in a increasing concave down curve in bitcoin price. Which I believe is well modeled by resources such as the bitcoin rainbow.This means that likely the halving of bitcoin will result in a far lower return for those who hope to sell at the top.I believe that the reason for the large bull run previously is mass distrust of government and fiat currency as a whole.Your probably saying ‚Äúwell no shit‚Äù. The importance of this observation is to understand that the key to long term price appreciation of bitcoin is actually mass adaptation and not the capped bitcoin supply.Unlike the limited supply, adaptation of bitcoin is not mathematically guaranteed. There are many obstacles we still have to overcome. Such as ease of access and government regulation. We have made great strides, such as lightning network.time in the market > timing the market",8 days ago,u/Gnassshhhh,16,65 comments
"Bitcoin will replace the dollar, but it won‚Äôt be sunshine and rainbows.","A new financial world order is somewhere over the horizon. It‚Äôs coming like it or not, The mantra of crypto is a revolution in money, but revolutions aren‚Äôt peaceful.The end of the dollar will have major implications for the United States and it‚Äôs Allies. The United States will no longer be able to run massive deficits, it‚Äôs Allies will be no longer able to depend on aid that the us provides. The centrally planned society will break apart due to lack of funding.The federal government funds everything from healthcare to energy to the military corporations to education and scientific research.The subsidies that the United States provides  to the us economy is staggering, ‚ÄúI want people to realize that a lot of people depend on the government for their employment.‚ÄùA bitcoin standard is an admission of defeat, the realization that printing money never works, and Marxism never solves the problems it states capitalism creates.Decentralization is the fundamental thesis on which America was built on, (which is absolute power corrupts absolutely)I don‚Äôt like to use the word ‚Äúcrash‚Äù so I‚Äôll say restructuring. Governments are soon gonna have to make hard decisions. Debt to GDP levels have become a national security threat. We are going to have to cut entitlements. reduce spending. Raise taxes. Balance the budget. Reduce energy consumption(see peak oil)this will result in a downtrend in the stock market. Because a reduction in spending leads to a reduction of economic activity.We might see a depression who knows? (Unless they cancel the debt, which isn‚Äôt a politically viable option. We seen what happened with student loans) so maybe a default?Regardless we are going to see pain. (And war possibly)But a new era will arise. A fair more equitable future. A system that holds people to account. Blockchain technology adds transparency. Stops mindless servitude and tyranny.Maybe the crypto anarchist were right all along. ‚ÄúYou have nothing to lose but barbed wire fences‚ÄùBitcoin will set us free.",8 days ago,u/trollingguru,2,39 comments

The potential threat of nuclear fusion to Bitcoin's existence,"Hey r/Bitcoin community,I know this may sound crazy, but bear with me for a moment. As we all know, Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates on a blockchain network. Its value is derived from its scarcity and the fact that it is not controlled by any government or financial institution. However, Bitcoin's survival could be at risk if and when nuclear fusion becomes a reality.Nuclear fusion is a process of generating energy by fusing atomic nuclei together. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the energy industry, providing an almost limitless source of clean energy. If this technology becomes mainstream, the demand for Bitcoin mining, which consumes a significant amount of energy, could decrease drastically.Currently, Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than entire countries like Argentina and the Netherlands. If nuclear fusion is successful, Bitcoin mining could become too expensive to be economically viable, resulting in a decline in demand and ultimately, its demise.Now, I'm not saying that nuclear fusion will definitely lead to Bitcoin's downfall. There are many factors to consider, such as the scalability and efficiency of nuclear fusion technology. However, it's important to keep in mind that Bitcoin's value is not guaranteed, and the emergence of new technologies could pose a threat to its existence.What are your thoughts on this? Do you think nuclear fusion could pose a threat to Bitcoin's survival?",9 days ago,u/ThibautAltF4,0,60 comments

3 Reasons Why Bitcoin is Ready for a Comeback,"3 Reasons Bitcoin Is poised for a comeback.Bitcoin Companies are regulatedBitcoin has had government recognition and approval since 2014. In March 2014, the IRS issued Notice 2014-21 (the Notice), mandating that bitcoin was to be recognized as property, rather than currency for US federal income tax purposes. By giving financial markets clarity on what bitcoin is, an entirely new #bitcoin industrial complex has emerged as companies expand into the digital frontier.2. #Bitcoin companies are registered.Every major bitcoin mining company, bank, or exchange that wants to have any formidable stake in the bitcoin sector has to comply with their respective Government‚Äôs financial departments. Coinbase just recently partnered with Black Rock, the largest asset manager in the world, with almost 10 trillion dollars under management. Once the serious players become fully established, don‚Äôt be surprised if governments subsidize different bitcoin mining companies, which would in turn generate job growth (due to higher entry level wages) and help stabilize a dilapidated energy grid.3. #Bitcoin politicians are respected.Ted Cruz, Cynthia Lummis, and other politicians have adopted bitcoin as a storage of value. Both she and Ted Cruz spoke extensively at a forum hosted by The Heritage Foundation.   Lummis has went on national television on more than one occasion and embraced bitcoin as a valuable property, as she is advocating for bitcoin as a retirement asset.   In an interview at CNBC‚Äôs financial advisor summit she explained that it‚Äôs important to support a scarce asset, ‚ÄúI encourage people to by and hold‚Ä¶‚ÄùTed Cruz orated on harnessing and recycling expended natural gas energy and using the excess natural energy to further stabilize the energy grid and mine for bitcoin, simultaneously.   Within the next two presidential elections, bitcoin will be a serious political issue, as it represents absolute ownership of property.Seizure of Property and assets is lawful through eminent domain and - if criminal activity is involved - civil forfeiture. Self-custody of bitcoin allows for American citizens to utilize their Constitutional Rights if their bitcoin ever came into question in regards to a lawful (or unlawful) seizure of assets.    It is important that humans around the world retain their right to property ownership because individual property ownership is analogous to Life, Liberty, and a democracy.Once more people understand the unique qualities that make bitcoin valuable property, politicians who enact local laws that enhance protections of bitcoin ownership will most likely be favored in campaign races. And the candidates who are in favor of protecting bitcoin property rights will eventually be encouraged to run for office.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVX1gX-shDc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVX1gX-shDc)",9 days ago,u/MathmaticMorpheus,0,11 comments

I‚Äôm so bullish,"I first heard about bitcoin in passing back during the 2017 bull run, but didn‚Äôt do much digging until 2020.

We witnessed so much death and destruction in the crypto industry, yet Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition hasn‚Äôt changed. This was when it finally hit me. We can hold our OWN COINS via self-custody.
